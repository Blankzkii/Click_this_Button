            <h1>Dear Krizel,</h1>
            <p class="paragraph-1">
               Hey Kriz time flies past real fast, we've been friends for like 7 months already and it's already 2026. Honestly, I didn't expect us to stay friends this long since I'm used to getting ghosted or people ditching me once they've had their fill of entertainment. But to my surprise, you didn't. At first, I thought you'd be a great friend and my best duo in Valorant and nothing more, but something in my mind was stirred and bloomed... then boom, I had a crush on you. It didn't stop there. Ever since I saw you IRL when we hanged out during my birthday and saw a glimps of you sipping your coffee, I realized that this is more than a crush now. Since you like getting letters, I decided to make one using my programming skills LMAO. It ain't much, but this is what I could come up with in a short amount of time. I tried to learn more about you, like how you'd rather have someone confess and court you instead of being the one to confess, which is understandable. So here I am, shooting my shot from the fucking Milky Way over to your heart.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-2">
               Krizel, I really like you to the point that a day without you feels bland and lacking. Even when I'm with friends playing games and talking, something feels missing, and it's you. Hanging out with you and talking to you makes my day, and even when you have your "topak," I'd still stay and wait for you to reply back to me. You are funny, clumsy, easy to agitate, and also "lutang" sometimes. When you get scared in horror games or get stuck and make me rescue you, I enjoy every bit of it. Trust me, it's not a bad thing you are super cute when you're just being yourself. I really admire how much you care about your family. When I hear about your situation with your kuya and how you give Jane money to help her out for school or allowance, it shows how big your heart is and how selfless you are. You keep saying that you're an independent woman, but I know deep inside you want someone to spoil you and take care of you, and I want to be that person for you. I want to be the one who makes you smile when you're down, the one who holds your hand when you're scared. I may not fit your ideal image like being singkit or someone who can dance and sing or someone who can shoot bows and arrows with wind power but what I can promise you is that I would treat you like you are my world, because that's how I see you. We may have some ups and downs, but that's what relationships are all about accepting each other's flaws. I know I'm not perfect, but I will do my damn best to make you happy and proud that I am your boyfriend. At this point, I really want to see you and hold your hand for this, but I know you need to recharge before going out to see me, and I am completely fine with it. I'll be patient for you. Just to be clear, this letter is not about us being in a relationship or dating immediately. This letter is a request for me to court you with the intention of wanting to date you. Just so you know, you are worth every effort and time when it comes to being with you, and you are not a burden to me. I hope you consider this letter and my feelings for you. Take your time, no rush. I'll be here waiting for your response.
                <br><br>
               P.S. Sorry for taking so long to confess. I was just scared of losing you as a friend, and it took me some time to gather the courage to do so. Also, this is my first time confessing through a letter never did this in my entire 23 years of my life. I'm sorry. Awit sayo
