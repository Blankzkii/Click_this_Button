            <h1>Dear Krizel,</h1>
            <p class="paragraph-1">
               Hey Kriz time flies past real fast, we've been friends for like 5 months already and it's already 2026. Honestly, I didn't expect us to stay friends this long since I'm used to getting ghosted or people ditching me once they've had their fill of entertainment. But to my surprise, you didn't. At first, I thought you'd be a great friend and my best duo in Valorant and nothing more, but something in my mind was stirred and bloomed... then boom, I had a crush on you. It didn't stop there. Ever since we started hanging out more often and playing together, I realized that this is more than a crush now. Since you like getting letters, I decided to make one using my programming skills LMAO. It ain't much, but this is what I could come up with in a short amount of time. I tried to learn more about you, like how you'd rather have someone confess and court you instead of being the one to confess, which is understandable. So here I am, shooting my shot from the fucking Milky Way over to your heart.


            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-2">
              Krizel, I really like you to the point that a day without you feels bland or lacking. Even with friends playing and talking to me, something feels missing, and it's you. Hanging out with you and talking to you makes my day, and even when you get your "Topak," I'd still stay and wait for you to reply back to me. You are funny, clumsy, easy to be agitated, and also "lutang" sometimes and trust me it is not a bad thing, you are very super cute when you are you. So don't change this much this year okayyy. I know I'm not handsome or "singkit" like Hemerson or Darren Espanto. Obviously, I don't have anemo powers like Venti, but trust me, I would treat you like you are my world and my everything. We may have some ups and downs, but that's what relationships are all about—accepting each other's flaws. I know I'm not perfect, but I will do my damn best to make you happy and proud that I am your boyfriend. At this point, I really want to see you and hold your hand for this, but I know you need to recharge in order to go out and see me, and I am fine with it. I'll be patient for you. Also, this letter is not about us being in a relationship or dating immediately, but this letter is a request for me to court you with the intention of wanting to date you. This might be too early to say but Krizel I love you and I really want to go out with you please.
            </p>
