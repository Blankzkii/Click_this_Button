                    I've been keeping this in for a while, but I think Valentine's Day is the perfect time to say it—you're the reason my days feel brighter. Every little moment with you means more than I can put into words. Your smile, your laughter, the way you make everything feel lighter—it all makes my heart race in the best way possible.
                </span>
                <br> <br>
                <span>
                    So, here it is… I like you, a lot. Maybe even love. Would you be my Valentine? No matter your answer, I just wanted you to know how special you are to me. You've filled my heart with warmth in ways I never expected, and for that, I'm grateful. But if you say yes, I promise to make every day feel like Valentine's Day for you—to cherish you, to make you smile, and to remind you just how much you mean to me.
